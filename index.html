            <p class="about"> I'm currently a Michgian State Senior studying Computer Science and Game Development. I'm 
                expected to graduate in May 2020. Through my Game Development program, I have had the opportunity to develope and program many 
                different games with many different mechanics and themes. I have taken the roles of gameplay 
                programmer and audio designer and programmer. I take a lot of joy in the project and content I have created. Through opportunities given to me, I have been able to excel 
                in both Gameplay Programming and Audi Design and Programming.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I have taken roles in Lead Audio and Sound Design on my recent projects. I have had to become familiar with music making and implementation.
                For theme music, I self-taught myself in making music through a tool known as <b>Logic Pro X</b>.
                Through this, I have made many differnt themes for games I have helped produce. Using both built in sounds, loops, and synth, I have made my own unqie 
                game music. I have also taught myself some music production by combinding this application with electronic keyboards and touch pads known as <b>Roli</b>. 
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                As for other sounds such as sound effects, I have been using both <b>Logic Pro X</b> and another tool <b>Reaper</b>. Using various microphones, such as <b>Blue Snowball</b>, 
                along with some online resources like <b>YouTube to MP3 Converters</b>.
