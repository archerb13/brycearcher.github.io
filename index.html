                    different games with many different mechanics and themes. I have taken the roles of gameplay 
                    programmer and audio designer and programmer. I take a lot of joy in the project and content I have created. Through opportunities given to me, I have been able to excel

                <p class="about">
                    I have taken roles in <b>Lead Audio and Sound Design</b> on my recent projects. I have had to become familiar with music making and implementation.
                    For theme music, I self-taught myself in making music through mainly <b>Ableton</b> and another tool <b>Logic Pro X</b>.
                    Through this, I have made many differnt themes for games I have helped produce. Using both built in sounds, loops, and synth, I have made my own unique 
                    game music. I have also taught myself some music production by combinding this application with electronic keyboards and touch pads known as <b>Roli</b>.

                    As for <b>sound effects</b>, I have been using both <b>Logic Pro X</b> and another tool <b>Reaper</b>. Using various microphones, such as <b>Blue Snowball</b>, 
                    along with some online resources like <b>YouTube to MP3 Converters</b>, I have created unique theme music and sound affects. Below is a link to my SoundCloud, where you will

                        Using our web app, a driver encompasses their house with a so called geo-fence, which is simply a geographic area that triggers an
                        action when the border of the geographic area is crossed. Once set, the garage door automatically opens when the vehicle crosses this
                        border when approaching the house, and automatically closes when the vehicle crosses the geo-fenced border when leaving the house.
