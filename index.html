            <p class="about"> I'm currently a Michgian State Senior studying Computer Science and Game Development. I'm 
                expected to graduate in <b>May 2020</b>. Through my Game Development program, I have had the opportunity to develope and program many 
                different games with many different mechanics and themes. I have taken the roles of gameplay 
                programmer and audio designer and programmer. I take a lot of joy in the project and content I have created. Through opportunities given to me, I have been able to excel 
                in both <b>Gameplay Programming</b> and <b>Audio Design and Programming</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I have taken roles in Lead Audio and Sound Design on my recent projects. I have had to become familiar with music making and implementation.
                For theme music, I self-taught myself in making music through a tool known as <b>Logic Pro X</b>.
                Through this, I have made many differnt themes for games I have helped produce. Using both built in sounds, loops, and synth, I have made my own unique 
                game music. I have also taught myself some music production by combinding this application with electronic keyboards and touch pads known as <b>Roli</b>. 
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                As for other sounds such as sound effects, I have been using both <b>Logic Pro X</b> and another tool <b>Reaper</b>. Using various microphones, such as <b>Blue Snowball</b>, 
                along with some online resources like <b>YouTube to MP3 Converters</b>, I have created unique theme musioc and sound affects. Below is a link to my SoundCloud, where yyou will 
                find majority of my sounds.

                        the name Purple Hat Productions, our team develpoed and presented Magic Cat in a Purple Hat as our MI 497 project,
